				<p id=paraone>Well, I started this assignment on 20th FEB 2022. I was unaware about the difficulties which I would face while completing this assignment.
				There were several chaos. Some of them were design idea, layout idea, etc. But the main one which was making me confuse was that, what should
				I use for the main content of the webpage.</p>
				<p id=paratwo>Firstly, I was only able to design the navigation menu, which I changed its design later. After completing the navigation part and making
				it consistent all over the pages, I focused on making the contact page which was little easier. Completion of contact page, starting for the
				idea of the deadliest HAMBURGER ICON was the most challenging task for me round this whole assignment. The reason I call it deadliest is that,
				every effort from me was being failed to animate it, even to implement it. Referencing from study materials in/outside the campus, I was successfull 
				to complete the assignment on time.</p>
				<p id=parathree>Despite the chaos, the experience which I gained from this assignment has helped me a lot to understand the basics of WEB-DEVELOPMENT. Also
				it fostered my typing speed. The experience with progress in this assignment was literally best. Valuation of time, lectures, different ideas
				of different people, matters the most. Hope to complete further assignments in future with proper guidence of our lecturers, module-leaders, who
				are very humble.</p>
