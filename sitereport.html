					<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
					<p> Under the progress of this assignment assigned to me by the university, I have faced a lot of situations. Some of them were difficult, enjoyable, and some were confusing too. Under the basics of web development, coding and designing, I enjoyed all the practical tutorials, gained the required ideas which are required for the basic web development. Under the proper guidance of module leader, lecturer and the administration, learning and understanding the materials in the first term was really an excellent achievement. Under this report, I will be discussing about my experience of module, development of this site, and lastly some attachments as a proof of the validation of the HTML and CSS codes used in these pages.</p>

					<h3>MODULE EXPERIENCE</h3>
					<p>  From the one month long foundation course, we were taught the proper way of writing a report with proper paraphrasing. We were also taught to design a mobile application and prepare for a university-level presentation. NAMI, which is all equipped with all the required learning materials and learning environment provided a lot of motivation. Module experience of CSY1014 (web-development) was all the way new to me. Before, I was very unknown about the web-development. With one month long online class, it was little difficult to implement the learned things to practical. With proper practice and effort, the outcomes became effective that I am able to develop a web-page even without taking any reference. The learning method is very effective as it includes a theory, tutorial and a discussion session. Helpful friends, cheerful lecturer, well-equipped classes were the plus-points which fostered the learning experience. My overall module experience is nice, but some part of the coding were difficult. Although, the difficult part is bound to be sort out in the discussion session by our lecturer.</p>

					<h3>DESIGN DECISION</h3>
					<p> The design decision came to my mind after thinking for several days. As this is my first assignment, it was little difficult for me to complete the design decisions. I took down several designs to my notebook, and asked help from my friends studying outside the campus. Finally I selected a design of the navigation menu, but was later changed as its view in the mobile was not nice. I have used the same fonts all-over the web-page. The navigation menu is consistent in all the web-pages. Things other than the HAMBURGER ICON were little bit easy. HAMBURGER ICON, the deadliest one, was one of the most difficult task for me. Referencing with other tutor-websites, it took me nearly 3 days just for the implementation of the HAMBURGER ICON. As, many of those tutors were using java-script for the HAMBURGER ICON, I lastly found a way to use it without any java-script too. With its installation, and with the completion of the home page, portfolio, contact page, and the blog I have completed the assignments and its time for the validation of the codes I used in the HTML and CSS files.</p>
